- Maybe remove imports of other repositorys inside of repository to prevent loops
- MORE COMMENTS
- Take some code from controllers and transfer it to repositories
- Make more small functions like "isFriend" or "hasChat" to validate requests
- Create loging/registering controllers
- Secure all endpoints and make them available for logged users or admins for certain endpoints
- Ensure that users can edit only their info/chats/messages/etc
- Style responses more and sort results
- Maybe split some methods to other controllers and repositories
